This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function. The program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  For large inputs, the program will crash due to stack overflow. A solution is provided that uses iteration to avoid this problem. This is an uncommon error in that it highlights the limitations of recursive functions in Hack when dealing with large inputs.
